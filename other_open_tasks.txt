Notes for all micro tasks that need to be done at some point, where we didn't finish a certain detail

- calculation of the circulating supply in the token_economy.py
- remove all dummy data usages
- add description and structure notes (e.g. # parameters, # state variables # policy inputs, ...) for every function
- consistency checks
- unique agent naming checks
- exchange for-loops for list comprehensions where possible
- error handling for functions and the whole model
