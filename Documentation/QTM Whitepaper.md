# Quantitative Token Model

The [Quantitative Token Model (QTM)](https://outlierventures.io/quantitative-token-model-a-data-driven-approach-to-stay-ahead-of-the-game/) is an open source spreadsheet model developed by [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io/). Its purpose is to forecast key metrics of different token economies on a higher level by abstracting a set of often leveraged token utilities. It should be used for educational purposes only and not to derive any financial advice. The market making for the token is approximated by a DEX liquidity pool with [constant product relationship](https://balancer.fi/whitepaper.pdf).

## Motivation and Benefits
It has always been a huge challenge to create a feasible web3 project economy. The rate of uncertainty when developing an idea, constructing a meaningful business model and  introducing value-adding token model has always come at a high cost for a founding team. The amount of variables and interdependencies causes a huge headache for the token designers and engineers on a way to constructing a value generating business model where the numbers add-up.

The Outlier Ventures took the first step into solving the challenges of complicated and costly validations of token economy feasibility introducing the Qualitative Token Model. Even though the spreadsheet model was a huge pain reliever for those who wanted to test out their assumptions on token economy there was a need for a tool that could provide answers to questions of a more advanced setting. There is a need to introduce a more complex and sophisticated logic supported by the agent-based modelling to bring the simulation result as close as it could be to the natural non-deterministic environment.

This tool is focused on providing an approach to design,validate and modify the token economy outlook for the project founders and stakeholder involved in token economy development. Among the major benefits we are looking to ease up the following processes of token economy development:
* Experiment with token utilities modifications
* Sophisticated agent behavior introductions
* Searching for economic feasibility in multiple extreme scenarios
* Stress testing of the parameters change
* Smoothing out the way to optimize ecosystem parameters
* Monitoring change and analyzing results


## 1.QTM Structure Breakdown

The QTM consists of the following elements:
1. Model inputs
2. Token and Signal flow architecture
3. The analysis section

### 1.2 Model Inputs
This element is dedicated to describe a specific environment of the project's token model. Here one can test out their hypothesis on the environmental settings of the token economy, user parameters, token utilities and how those affect the financial stability of the crypto project. For convenience the Model inputs are split into the 3 blocks:
* Fundraising
* Inputs 
* Utility modules


#### 1.2.1 Fundraising
In this section building blocks describe:
1. Basic Token Parameters - identifies the basic token setting one wishes to implement in their crypto project, including future valuation and share of equity owned by external shareholders, or in other words share of project valuation to be excluded from the project token capitalization.(The complete table can be found at A.1.1)

2. Fundraising Module - defines the projectâ€™s fundraising goals at the different token sale stages and expenses in the form of bonuses given to the seed and pre-sale investors (The complete table can be found at A.1.2)

3. Initial token allocation and Vesting schedules  - includes an extensive list of allocation pools for you to match your distribution plans. (The complete table can be found at A.1.3)

#### 1.2.2 Inputs 
The Inputs section describes the price setting and expected amount of initial liquidity along with expected user project adoption. The given settings are then matched with the expected project's financial model.
The Inputs section comprises the following blocks:
* Liquidity Pool Module - describes the token price at launch, parameters of funds allocation to the liquidity pools and the paired token information.*
 *add information on how such numbers are derived*

* User Adoption -  includes parameters expected user base, product adoption, hypothesis on token adoption and use in a form of expected utility, holding, selling and utility removal allocation. (The complete table can be found at A.2.2)

* Business Assumptions - comprises expected project revenue streams  and expenses forming a quasi general project budget model. (The complete table can be found at A.2.3)


#### 1.2.3 Utility Modules
The Utility Modules sections if focused on activation/ or deactivation of certain utilities. In also includes an assumed weighting with respect to token allocation and specific parameters for each individual utility out of Holding, Burning, Locking, Transferring and Liquidity Mining.  The Utility Modules consist of the following blocks:

* Utility adoption distribution - 
* Utility Modules
